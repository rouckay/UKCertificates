<h3>Are You Losing Money Because You Don’t Know How CE Marking Certification Works?</h3>
<p>The letters "CE" are the acronym of French phrase "Conformité Européene" which literally means "European Conformity". The term primarily used was "EC Mark" and it was formally replaced by "CE Marking" in the Directive 93/68/EEC in 1993. "CE Marking" is now used in all EU official documents.</p>
<h3>Does my product need CE Marking? </h3>
<p>CE Marking is most probably required if you export to the 27 European Union (EU) and 3 European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states the following 20 groups of products - </p>
<ul class="ul">
<li><strong>Appliances Burning Gaseous Fuels (AppliGas) </strong><br />The "appliances burning gaseous fuels" used for cooking, heating, hot water production, refrigeration, lighting or washing and having, where applicable, a normal water temperature not exceeding 105 gC.

<li><strong>Protective systems</strong> means design units which are intended to halt incipient explosions immediately and/or to limit the effective range of explosion flames and explosion pressures. Protective systems may be integrated into equipment or separately placed on the market for use as autonomous systems.</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong> means any item essential to the safe functioning of equipment and protective systems but with no autonomous function. Explosive atmospheres Mixture with air, under atmospheric conditions, of flammable substances in the form of gases, vapours, mists or dusts in which, after ignition has occurred, combustion spreads to the entire unburned mixture.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>concerning a congenital abnormality, or</li>
<li>to determine the safety and compatibility with potential recipients, or</li>
<li>to monitor therapeutic measures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Non-automatic Weighing Instruments </strong><br /><p>A "Weighing Instrument" is defined as a measuring instrument serving to determine the mass of a body by using the action of gravity on that body.
